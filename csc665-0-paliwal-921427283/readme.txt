* Use ‘+’ operation to add the arguments a, b. They could be integers or strings
* Return a+ b. 


buyLotsOfFruit.py


* totalCost variable is declared and initialised with 0.00 value.
* for loop is used on orderlist to iterate on fruit name and quantity. 
* Use the name to pull out it’s price per pound from the dictionary and multiply with quanity. This is then added to the totalCost variable and it is updated. This is repeated for all fruits in the orderList. 
* Outside for loop return totalCost to be used to print the final output. 


shopSmart.py


* To solve this problem,  two variables were initialized, min_price - to store minimum price value and min_price_shop to store the name of the store with min price.
* Implement for loop on fruitShops and pass orderlist as an argument to iterate on fruitShop and calculate price for each shop
* Use If condition in each iteration to compare the price with the min_price & each time the price was lower, it updated the two variables. 
* Outside for loop return the min_price_shop so that it could be used in printing the final output
